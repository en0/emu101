# EMU101 - A python implementation

Originally, this was intended to learn how to right emulators. Then I
got carried away and designed an entirely fictitious system architecture.
I am refering to this architecture as EMU101.

I have desgined this processor as a block diagram and deduced an instruction
set based on control signals that would be used to set Mux and ALU operations.
To be clear, this thing doesn't exist except as an emulator.
