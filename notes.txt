## Thinking about the assembly language

# From memory
lda some_const # Load a with some_constant
ldr r1         # Load r1 with the data pointed to by a
ldr r2         # Load r1 with the data pointed to by a
str r1         # Store r1 into the memory pointed to by a
str r2         # Store r2 into the memory pointed to by a

# Transfer
mov r2,r1      # move the value in r1 into r2
mov r1,r2      # move the value in r2 into r1
mov a,r1       # move the value in r1 into a
mov a,r2       # move the value in r2 into a
mov r1,a       # move the value in a into r1
mov r2,a       # move the value in a into r2

# Increment/Decrement
inc a          # Increment a
inc r1         # Increment r1
inc r2         # Increment r2
dec a          # decrement a
dec r1         # decrement r1
dec r2         # decrement r2

# Math
add            # r1 + r2
sub            # r1 - r2

# Bitwise
and            # r1 & r2
or             # r1 | r2
xor            # r1 ^ r2
not r1         # not(r1)
not r2         # not(r2)

# Stack
push r1        # push r1 onto the stack
push r2        # push r2 onto the stack
push a         # push a onto the stack
pushf          # push flags onto stack
pusha          # pushs a, r1, r2, flags onto the stack

pop r1        # pop r1 from the stack
pop r2        # pop r2 from the stack
pop a         # pop a from the stack
popf          # pop flags from stack
popa          # pops a, r1, r2, flags from the stack

# Comparison
cmp           # Compaire r1 and r2 and set flags
              # if r1 == r2 = zf=1, sf=0
              # if r1 < r2 = zf=0, sf=0
              # if r1 > r2 = zf=0, sf=1
